install node
npm init @vitejs/app (pick vanilla js here)
cd your-project
npm install
npm install three
npm run dev (start editing, every change made to any of the files will be reflected live)

and when youâ€™re done

npm run build (minifies, optimizes, tree shakes, makes sure older browsers can run it, etc)

you can now deploy the contents of /build
